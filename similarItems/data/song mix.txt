[Verse 1: Kelly Clarkson & John Legend]
I really can't stay (Baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (But, I can call you a ride)
This evening has been (I'm so glad that you dropped in)

What a bright time, it’s the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh

[Bridge]
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

[Verse 3]
And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbyeing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow

Bring us pudding
Bring us pudding
Bring us pudding
And a cup of good cheer

[Verse 5]
You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch
You're the king of sinful sots
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched with moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch
Your soul is an appalling dump heap overflowing with the most disgraceful
Assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable, mangled up in tangled up knots!

It’s the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings
When friends come to call
It’s the hap-happiest season of all

So have yourself a merry little Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
So have yourself a merry little Christmas

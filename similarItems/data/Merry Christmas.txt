Bring us pudding
Bring us pudding
Bring us pudding
And a cup of good cheer

We won’t go ’til we get some
We won’t go ’til we get some
We won’t go until we get some
So bring it out here!

We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
And a happy New Year

We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a happy New Year.
